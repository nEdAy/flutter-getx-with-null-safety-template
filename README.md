A new Flutter Module template project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.dev/).

For instructions integrating Flutter modules to your existing applications,
see the [add-to-app documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app).

## Branch name rule

- master - flutter template release
- develop - flutter template development
- release
    - allowed branch name: release/{projectKey}/{majorVersion}.{minorVersion}.0
        - example: release/xxx/1.0.0
    - hotfix
        - allowed branch name: hotfix/{projectKey}/{majorVersion}.{minorVersion}.{patchVersionInMasterBranch+1}
        - example: hotfix/xxx/1.0.1
    - feature
        - allowed branch name: feature/{projectKey}/{storyOrBugOrDefectOrIncidentName}/{domainAccountName}
        - example: feature/xxx/add-flutter-to-android/nEdAy

## GitFlow

- master and developer branch have to be with infinite lifecycle
- release branches could be multiple for different iteration
- hotfix branches could be created after production incident occurred
- master, develop, release and hotfix branches have to be protected
- feature branches are temporary ones for developers


## Unit Test

- flutter test // Executing unit tests
- flutter test --coverage // Generating coverage reports /coverage/Icov.info
- SonarQube plugin for Flutter / Dart
    - https://github.com/insideapp-oss/sonar-flutter
- Run analysis
  Use the following commands from the root folder to start an analysis:
    - Download dependencies
        - flutter pub get
    - Run tests
        - flutter test --machine > tests.output
    - Compute coverage (--machine and --coverage cannot be run at once...)
        - flutter test --coverage
    - Run the analysis and publish to the SonarQube server
        - sonar-scanner
